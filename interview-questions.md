# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: MVC stands for model-view-controller.

  Researched answer: MVC stands for model-view-controller where model handles data, controller handles application and view handles UI presentation. In practice this means that the browser sends a request to the controller which retrieves the data it needs and hands it back over to the controller, the view is then rendered for the end user when the browser displays the content requested.



2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: SQL is a relational database, there are other kinds of databases, such as noSQL which seem overwhelmingly confusing.
  Researched answer: A relational database, such as SQL stores data points that are related to one another, like the columns and rows in a spreadsheed. Non-relational databaese, i.e noSQL databases, use a different storage model which is optimized for the specifiv types of data being stored. 



3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: Object-relational mapping creates a layer of communication between the programming language and the databases storing information.

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming and databases don't always work well together, object relational mapping is effectively a translator allowing programmers to work with the data in the databases without a barrier by converting the data and overcoming incompatable types.



4. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a package manager for Ruby.

  Researched answer: Gems are opensource libraries that allow programmers to use the code contained in them within their projects, for example, RSPEC is a gem that allows you to test Ruby code.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are generated in relational databases and are unique identifiers for the data being stored. For example, in a table called Jimmy Johns, each sandwich(row) would have a unique primary key by which it could be referred to via association.
